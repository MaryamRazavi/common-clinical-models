			purpose = <"The SAS can be applied to any patient who is postop from major surgery.The SAS can often predict the risk of complication more objectively than clinician gestalt; in one study, it correlated well with admission to an ICU setting (when not initially admitted to an intensive care setting).">

The Surgical Apgar Score correlates directly with outcome -- the higher the score, the lower the risk of complication.

Complications were defined as:, Acute renal failure, Bleeding requiring ≥ 4 U red cell transfusion within 72 hours after operation,Cardiac arrest requiring CPR, Coma for 24 hours or longer, Deep venous thrombosis, Septic shock, MI, Unplanned intubation, Ventilator use for ≥48 hours, Pneumonia, Pulmonary embolism, Stroke, Wound disruption, Deep or organ-space surgical site infection, Sepsis, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and Vascular graft failure, according to NSQIP’s established definitions.
All deaths were considered major complications.

Patients having complications categorized in the database as “other occurrence” were reviewed individually to determine the severity of the complication. Anastomotic leak, cystic duct leak after cholecystectomy, pericardial effusion requiring drainage, and gastric outlet obstruction requiring reoperation were identified on review of these individual occurrences and classified as major complications.

Superficial surgical site infection and urinary tract infection were not major complications.
